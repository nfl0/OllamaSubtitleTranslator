1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:02,840
Scammed in Oost?  
- Damn it, really?

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:05,913
Get down. They’ll give you something, then you can start trading in your neighborhood.

3
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:07,847
Move forward, Chupa Chups.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,200
Don’t invite strangers, okay?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
I’m not talking to you, man. I’m talking to him.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,040
Open it.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,640
Abdelhak Taheri, sir.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,440
I want the exact coordinates of your South American contact, Auntie Alvarez.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,526
What are you doing?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,786
I have news: Uncle has some major deals with the Mexicans.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,240
Where’s Duane?

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,253
I hope your friend will cooperate…

13
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,860
otherwise, it’ll be the end of the road for him… and things.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,240
You said I’d end up like this, didn’t you?
- Wollah, I didn’t teach you that.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,440
I swear he’s coming.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,960
Tell your uncle to screw off, yeah?

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,127
A: TONNANO  
MY Uncle HAS POPE. BRING THE ARMY NOW.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Listen, Adil, tomorrow in court  
you’re going to get hit hard…

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,880
it’s gonna be rough,

20
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,000
Hurry up.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,260
Hurry up! We're leaving.

22
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,060
I've gathered the troops.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
How many men do we have? - Four. And they're all armed.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,947
I'm going to take care of their mothers today.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,413
I can't rest until this is done. He's family.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
Let Goddamn their mothers’ bloodline.

27
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,193
If they don't die today, they'll die tomorrow. Today is the day everything blows up.

28
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,886
Take it easy. We'll track him down.

29
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,593
Yes, we'll find him.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
And bring him back. This is bigger than just you.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,760
It’s also about me, right?

32
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,706
We’re going after him.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Understood?

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,493
Palace of Justice

35
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,093
So you're finally here? - Yes.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,880
They put my father in an institution.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Completely buried in dirt.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,680
He really can't come back.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Who will help him? God willing.

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
- Who should help him? - God willing.

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
In court.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,560
Please take your seats.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,560
The session begins.

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
We are gathered here today to decide...

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,680
whether the detention of Mr. El Haddaoui will be extended.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Therefore, first, I would like to give the floor to the officer.

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Thank you, Madam President. Your Honor.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,680
This is the situation, and I won’t mince words.

49
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,840
The prosecution, in cooperation with the IFN,

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,640
and the national criminal investigation department

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,080
This is the first translated subtitle.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,600
is "Soy yo. Calma." Literally, "It's me. Calm." But in context, it might be better as "It’s me. Stay calm."  
Moving on to

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
Look here, dad.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,200
I brought someone with me.

55
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,226
He’ll help you.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,426
Peace be upon you, Abdelhak.

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,580
Do you remember who I am?

58
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,540
Yeah? How are you?

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Within the criminal organization...

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,800
extremely popular.

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,080
Criminals stick to the belief...

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,480
that encryption on these devices can't be cracked...

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,840
and freely converse.

64
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
That's a misconception.

65
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,365
Thanks to our colleagues' relentless efforts...

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,685
at the IFN,

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,360
we managed to crack the Icelandic servers we seized.

68
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,680
Because of our success in cracking those Icelandic servers,

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
the prosecution obtained access to

70
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,560
over six million written messages,

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,246
just like the familiar WhatsApp messages everyone knows.

72
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,440
We also know that one of his aliases...

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
is Mr. El Haddaoui's.

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,240
'knock-out' / 'KO'.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
When mentioning "knock-out" or "KO", it translates directly as "'knock-out' / 'KO'."

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,080
And that’s why I can give a preview here.

77
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,920
Esteemed Mr. President, Members of the Court, we request...

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,400
that the defendant remain...

79
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,840
in preventive custody for another ninety days...

80
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,000
to allow time for the fiscal authorities...

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,480
Let’s thoroughly examine this material.

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Thanks.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
Keep quiet in the courtroom.

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
Be silent!

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,400
Silence.

86
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Hello.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Let’s move. Let’s go.

88
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:42,933
Zakaria, stand up.

89
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,940
Zakaria, rise.

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Where in the hell were you?

91
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,466
The entire block is blocked off.

92
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,826
Cops everywhere.

93
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,926
It's all right here.

94
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,213
I swear to God, if I see that son of a bitch...

95
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,406
I'll drill two bullets into his head.

96
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,793
Where the hell is the gun?

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,800
Come on in.

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,099
Everything’s gone.

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Hi. Come here.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Come here.
