1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:02,840
They double-crossed him in Oost. 
- Damn, seriously?

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:05,913
Get down. They'll give you something to get started dealing in your neighborhood.

3
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:07,847
Come on, Chupa Chups.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,200
Don't bring weird people around here, okay?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
I'm not talking to you, pal. I'm talking to him.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,040
Open it.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,640
Abdelhak Taheri.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,440
I want the exact location of your South American contact, Tía Alvarez.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,526
What are you doing?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,786
I have news. The guy has dealings with the Mexicans.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,240
Where's Duane?

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,253
I hope your friend cooperates... otherwise it'll be curtains for him too.

13
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,860
You taught me that, jerk.
- Wollah, I didn't teach you anything.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,240
I swear he's coming.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,440
Tell your uncle to go to hell, alright?

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,960
A: TONNANO! MY UNCLE HAS POPE. BRING THE ARMY.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,127
Listen Adil, tomorrow in court, you'll receive a crushing blow...

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,080
...a tough one to swallow, I'm going to nail you.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,880
Hurry up.

20
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,000
Come on, hurry up, let's go.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,260
I have the army organized.

22
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,060
How many? - Four, and they're armed.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
Today I'm going to make them pay for this.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,947
I swear, it won't sit well with me. He's family.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,413
I swear, I won't feel good. He's family.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
May God curse their mothers.

27
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,193
If they don't die today, they will die tomorrow.

28
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,886
Today is the day everything explodes in their faces.

29
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,593
Calm down. We'll find your cousin.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Yes, we will find him.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,760
And we're going to bring him back. This isn't just about you. It's about me too.

32
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,706
Also me, right?

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Let's go get him.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,493
Got it?

35
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,093
PALACE OF JUSTICE

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,880
So, you're finally here? - Yes.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,840
They put my father in an institution... buried deep in filth.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,680
He can't come back from this.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Who will help him? - Inshallah.

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
- Who should help him?
- Inshallah.

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
The tribunal is now in session.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,560
Please, take a seat.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,560
Court is convened.

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
We are here to determine...

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,680
whether Mr. El Haddaoui's pre-trial detention should be extended.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,840
To begin, I would like to give the floor to the officer.

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Thank you, Madam President. Members of the Court.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,680
Straight to the point then.

49
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,840
The prosecution, in collaboration with the IFN, and the national department of criminal investigation...

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,640
have made a remarkable discovery.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,080
has led to a spectacular breakthrough.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,600
It's me. Calm down. Look here, Dad.

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
I brought someone with me. He's going to help you.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,200
Peace be upon you, Abdelhak.

55
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,226
Do you recognize me?

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,426
Yes? How are you?

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,580
Within the criminal organization...

58
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,540
it is common practice to use so-called PGP phones – extremely prevalent.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Within the criminal organization...

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,800
it is customary use of so-called PGP phones, extremely popular.

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,080
Criminals operate under the assumption...

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,480
...that encryption on these devices is unbreakable...

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,840
...and allows them to speak freely.

64
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
That's a dangerous misconception.

65
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,365
Thanks to the tireless work of our IFN colleagues, we've managed to crack the seized Icelandic servers.

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,685
Cracking those Icelandic servers has enabled the prosecution to obtain...

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,360
over 6 million written messages—similar to WhatsApp conversations we all recognize.

68
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,680
We also know that one alias used by Mr. El Haddaoui is “knock-out”—or KO for short.

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
And that's why I can present a preview now.

70
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,560
Esteemed President, members of the Court, we request...

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,246
...that the defendant remain in pre-trial detention for an additional 90 days to allow the prosecution...

72
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,440
We also know that one of the aliases...

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
of Mr. El Haddaoui

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,240
is “knock-out”.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
Or KO.

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,080
And that's why I can do a preview here.

77
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,920
Esteemed President, members of the Court, we request...

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,400
that the defendant remain...

79
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,840
in pre-trial detention for another 90 days

80
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,000
to allow the prosecution...

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,480
I need to thoroughly analyze that evidence.

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Thank you, sir.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
Order in the courtroom.

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
Silence, please.

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,400
Quiet!

86
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Hello there.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Come on, come on.

88
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:42,933
Zakaria, get up here.

89
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,940
Zakaria, you need to come up.

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Where the hell have you been?

91
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,466
The whole damn street is blocked off. Cops everywhere.

92
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,826
It's all there.

93
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,926
I swear, if I see that damn bum...

94
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,213
I'll blow his brains out with two bullets.

95
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,406
Where's that gun?

96
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,793
Ibo, please.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,800
Everything vanished.

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,099
Hey, come here. Come closer.

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Here, come here.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Come here.
